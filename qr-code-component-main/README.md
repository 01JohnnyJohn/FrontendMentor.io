## My process

Generally, it was not hard.
Mostly, I need and want to practice how to right code methodically, logically, adherently, practice following a correct workflow, instead of jumping from one part to another, making small adjustments here and there.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
